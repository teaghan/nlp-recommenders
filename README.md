# NLP Recommenders

Welcome to "NLP Recommenders," a repository dedicated to exploring the intersection of Recommender Systems and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This evolving collection features a range of projects and explorations, starting from the basics of Recommender Systems and gradually integrating NLP techniques to augment their capabilities. We begin with foundational concepts and methods in recommender systems, then transition into incorporating NLP, showcasing how these technologies can work in tandem to create more intelligent and nuanced systems.
